    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we've built a research agent using the OpenAI Agents SDK with proper configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent Creation** - Setting up agents with custom instructions and tools\n",
    "2. **Correct Runner Usage** - Using `Runner.run_sync()` and `Runner.run()` with `RunConfig`\n",
    "3. **Basic Tracing** - Monitoring agent execution with workflow names and trace management\n",
    "4. **Configuration Management** - Using `RunConfig` for tracing and workflow organization\n",
    "5. **Best Practices** - Error handling, structured configuration, and session management\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `RunConfig` to configure tracing, not direct parameters\n",
    "- Always use workflow names for better trace organization\n",
    "- The `trace()` context manager groups multiple operations\n",
    "- Disable sensitive data in traces for production use\n",
    "- Structure your code with proper error handling and configuration management\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Real API Integration** - Connect to actual academic databases and search APIs\n",
    "2. **Advanced Tracing** - Explore custom spans and trace processors\n",
    "3. **Agent Handoffs** - Build multi-agent research workflows\n",
