      "Recent climate research highlights that the Earth's ability to safely store carbon dioxide underground is much lower than previously estimated, and that ocean carbon sinks are declining due to rising sea surface temperatures, both of which could impact climate mitigation efforts[1][2].\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers now estimate that **Earth’s practical capacity to store CO₂ underground is about 1,460 gigatonnes (GtCO₂)**—far less than the often-cited figure of up to 40,000 GtCO₂. This limit could be reached as early as 2200, with significant implications for carbon capture and storage strategies. To stay within the Paris Agreement target of 1.5–2°C warming, carbon storage would need to increase 175-fold by mid-century[1].\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, **record-high sea surface temperatures in 2023 led to an unexpected decline in the ocean’s ability to absorb carbon**. Ocean carbon sinks have not increased as expected, weakening an essential natural buffer against atmospheric CO₂ rises[2].\n",
      "\n",
      "Most climate models predict that **changes in cloud cover will significantly amplify warming**: a decrease in low-level clouds and an increase in high-level clouds could result in temperature rises of 4°C or more, escalating sea-level rise and deadly heatwaves[3].\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent studies also highlight important societal and ecological impacts:\n",
      "- **Drought and aridity are shown to substantially increase internal migration**, affecting different regions and demographics differently[4].\n",
      "- The **structure of forest canopies influences autumn timings in temperate forests** by regulating microclimates, affecting ecosystem models and predictions[4].\n",
      "- In China, **public concern for climate change is rising**, with increased prioritization possibly spurring stronger support for climate policies[5].\n",
      "\n",
      "These findings underscore mounting challenges in both the natural and social dimensions of climate response, emphasizing that technological and political changes will be required to meet global climate goals.\n",
