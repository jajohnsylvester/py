# Title: Impact of Quantum Computing on Cybersecurity

## Summary
Quantum computing poses a significant threat to current cybersecurity practices by potentially rendering existing encryption methods obsolete. As quantum computers advance, they could decrypt sensitive data protected by algorithms like RSA and ECC, necessitating the development and adoption of post-quantum cryptography to ensure data security.

## Key Findings
1. Quantum computers can break widely used encryption methods such as RSA and ECC, compromising data security.
2. 'Harvest now, decrypt later' attacks involve collecting encrypted data now to decrypt once quantum capabilities are available.
3. Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is being developed to create algorithms resistant to quantum attacks.
4. Organizations are urged to begin transitioning to PQC to maintain cyber resilience.
5. Government initiatives, like the USA Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act, are promoting the shift to quantum-safe systems.
